### not
If anyone is interested in the halfway point between Geeknote & *a random collection of .txt files in $HOME*, meet me in the middle with 'not (note w/o the [e]vernote)', a low-friction, dumb as rocks, evernote based notekeeping thing.


### rationale
i need to take notes on a daily basis, but i hate all note taking software

i just want to scratch down some crap in vi and save it somewhere safe and synced

[Geeknote](http://www.geeknote.me/) is cool (and largely inspired not), but it's super feature rich and requires extra brain workyness that I don't often have.

`not` and I'm done

### install
`python setup.py install`


### usage
`not` -- creates or updates a note using your favorite editor, stored in default notebook, named after today's date

`not some_title` same thing, but instead of todays date it's whatever custom title you wrote

* all notes are plaintext
* no notebook customization, just the default notebook
* line breaks and html aren't handled that well, sorry
* open to pull requests as long as the philosophy remains unchanged
